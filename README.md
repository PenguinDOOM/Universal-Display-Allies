# Universal-Display-Allies
zandronum mod

DO NOT REUPLOAD TO TSPG (Same for older versions) Submit a ban request to the admin for that mod.  
What I forbid is reuploading old versions, or reuploading simply by renaming.  

## Can I incorporate it into my project?
Yes! No problem.  
However, credit must be indicated. Just copy the contents of the license file.
